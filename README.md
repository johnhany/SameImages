SameImages
==========

Find, delete and rename same images in a directory.


Using OpenCV library.


By transforming an image into a string, we can create a digital id for each image.


By comparing the ids, we can find similar, even same images.


Then delete the redundant images and rename all rest of the images with its own ids.
